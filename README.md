# orca-validation-python

This is a working example of how to build a [Validation URL](https://orcascan.com/guides/barcode-scan-validation-webhook-56928ff9) for [Orca Scan](https://orcascan.com/) using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask).

**Why?** When someone scans a barcode in the Orca Scan app, you might want to check the data before it gets saved. A Validation URL lets you:

- **Reject bad data** - block a scan if a value is missing, out of range, or a duplicate
- **Modify data** - auto-format, trim, or fill in fields before saving
- **Guide the user** - show a success, warning, or error message right in the app

## How it works

When a user scans a barcode or edits a field, Orca Scan sends a POST request to your server with the full row data:

```json
{
    "___orca_sheet_name": "Vehicle Checks",
    "___orca_user_email": "user@example.com",
    "___orca_row_id": "abc123",
    "Barcode": "orca-scan-test",
    "Name": "Orca Scan"
}
```

Fields starting with `___` are Orca system fields that describe the context of the scan. Everything else matches your sheet column names exactly (case and spaces matter).

Your server responds to tell Orca Scan what to do:

| Response                        | What happens                                                 |
|:--------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| HTTP 204                        | Allow - data saves as-is                                     |
| HTTP 200 with fields            | Modify - Orca Scan updates the fields you return, then saves |
| HTTP 400 with `___orca_message` | Reject - user sees an error and the save is blocked          |

### In-app messages

You can show messages in the app by including `___orca_message` in your response:

```json
{
    "___orca_message": {
        "display": "notification",
        "type": "success",
        "message": "Item verified"
    }
}
```

| Field     | Value          | Description                        |
|:----------|:---------------|:-----------------------------------|
| `display` | `notification` | Brief banner at the top of the app |
|           | `dialog`       | Popup the user must dismiss        |
| `type`    | `success`      | Green                              |
|           | `warning`      | Yellow                             |
|           | `error`        | Red                                |

> Your server must respond within 750ms or Orca Scan will ignore the response.

## Getting started

You'll need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.8+ installed (`python3 --version` to check) and an [Orca Scan](https://orcascan.com/) account.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orca-scan/orca-validation-python.git
cd orca-validation-python
```

**macOS or Linux**
```bash
python3 -m venv orca && source ./orca/bin/activate
```

**Windows**
```bash
python -m venv orca && .\orca\Scripts\activate
```

**All platforms**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```

Your server is now running at `http://localhost:8888`.

## Try it

Use [cURL](https://curl.se/) to send a test request from your terminal (just like Orca Scan would):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'orca-sheet-name: Vehicle Checks' \
  -H 'orca-secret: your-secret-here' \
  -d '{
    "___orca_sheet_name": "Vehicle Checks",
    "___orca_user_email": "user@example.com",
    "___orca_row_id": "abc123",
    "Barcode": "orca-scan-test",
    "Name": "Orca Scan"
  }'
```

- `Name` is 9 characters, which is under 20 - you should get an empty `HTTP 204` response (data allowed)
- Change `"Name"` to something longer than 20 characters and you should get `HTTP 400` with an error message (data rejected)

## Connect to Orca Scan

Orca Scan needs to reach your server over the internet. During development, [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) creates a temporary public URL that points to your machine:

```bash
npx localtunnel --port 8888
```

Copy the URL it gives you and paste it in Orca Scan under **Integrations > Events API > Validation URL**.

When you're ready to go live, deploy to any Python host and update the URL.

## Security

Set a secret in Orca Scan (**Integrations > Events API > Secret**) and Orca Scan will send it as an `orca-secret` header with every request. Verify it on your server to make sure the request is genuine. See the commented example in [server.py](server.py).
